When we see the passing rate reading (85.80%) has a higher rate than math (74.98 % ),the overall passing rate is 65.17%. This indicates that student's score more in reading than math.

* The school summary showed that from 15 schools 7 of them are found at the district level, and the other 8 of them found at the charter level. The number of students in schools ranged between 427 students to 4976 students. The data also showed that district schools have more students than charter schools. We can conclude that district schools have more students than charter schools because of their geographical coverage.
